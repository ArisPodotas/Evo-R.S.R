# Overview:

Evo R.S.R is an algorithm written in python that tries to emulate, in a very simplified manner, the emergence of a given reference sequence from randomly generated sequences of the same length. It allows the users to input a desired DNA sequence (either from NCBI or a custom one, by inputting the nucleotides manually) and then generates random sequences of the same length which are then mutated randomly. The sequences of the mutated population then cross randomly with each other generating offspring sequences. The offspring sequences are generated by choosing a random part of one parent's sequence and fusing it with the remaining part of the other parent's sequence, in a way emulating the recombination process. From the offspring population, the average distance of each sequence from the reference sequence is calculated and offspring with lower percentage similarity to the reference sequence than the average are discarded. The number of times this process will run is determined by factors such as the mutation rate, the size of the population and the number of generations (all of which can be changed via command line arguments or be left at a preset default value). The output files of the algorithm are a txt file containing the history of the population until it reaches the reference sequence or dies and a graph showing the size of the population and its average similarity to the reference sequence across generations.

# DISCLAMER

This branch of the code is being maintained by one of the original authors and is in development and not aiming to do what the original did.
# Getting started:

Evo R.S.R requires a 64-bit computer running either Linux, windows or Mac OS X. 

# Inspiration

The idea comes from inquiries into ancetral sequence reconstruction and scientific articles like Mascotti M. L. (2022). Resurrecting Enzymes by Ancestral Sequence Reconstruction. Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.), 2397, 111–136. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-0716-1826-4_7

# Install

# Usage

- ## With the current built in usage

```
Usage:
[-h][shows a list of all commands].
[-acc][accession number: can be empty].
[-email][Your email. Required if an accession number is provided to fetch the sequence from NCBI].
[-o][output_path: can be empty (inputs default value)].
[-gen][number for size of each generation: Must be greater than 0. Can be empty (inputs default value)].
[-size][number for size of the population: Must be greater than 0. Can be empty (inputs default value)].
[-rate][mutation rate: Must be greater than 0. Can be empty (inputs default value)].
[-v][Verbose: prints processes on screen].
[-q][Quiet: stops printing output (may increase speed)].
[-drift][Defines a genetic drift parameter that kills individuals randomly].
[-criteria][Defines a selection criteria for natural selection, warning may cause population to die easily].
[-log][Creates a log file to track run].
[-hom][Homogeneity: Determines how to create the very first generation of organisms (if given will make the population as homogeneous as homogeneity.
)

### Population simulation with R.S.R

Example simulations:

    The original Evo_RSR.py file contains a main function that is the same as in example.py

- ### Help screen

```
python ".\Evo_R.S.R.py" -h
```

- ### Base run

```
python ".\Evo_R.S.R.py"
```

Alternative

```
python example.py
```

- ### Custom run

```
python ".\Evo_R.S.R.py" -v -size 100 -gen 100 -rate 0.7 -regressions -o.
```

## Note

The Population class is contained within thr Person calss dispite not inheriting from the calss because it creates multiple instances of the Person class withing its __init__ methon, though never calling the super() function.

# CS50P specific information

## Note

This program was originally the final project for cs50P but has since grown into a standalone program.
The version of this repository is unique.
